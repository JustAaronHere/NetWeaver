# NetWeaver

> **From packets to perfection** ‚Äî The network intelligence framework that finally does it all.

NetWeaver is a high-performance, open-source network toolkit that combines the raw speed of C with the safety and elegance of Rust. It's designed for developers, system administrators, and security professionals who need deep network visibility without juggling multiple tools.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

**System Requirements:**
- Linux (kernel 3.10+), macOS (10.13+), or BSD
- Rust 1.70 or higher
- GCC or Clang for C compilation
- libpcap development headers (optional, for packet capture)

**Development Tools:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libpcap-dev

# Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
sudo dnf install gcc make pkg-config libpcap-devel

# macOS (requires Homebrew)
brew install libpcap
```

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netweaver.git
cd netweaver

# Build the project (this compiles both C and Rust code)
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at target/release/netweaver
# Optionally install it system-wide
sudo cp target/release/netweaver /usr/local/bin/
```

**Note:** Some features require elevated privileges. On Linux/macOS, you may need to run NetWeaver with `sudo` or grant the binary specific capabilities:

```bash
# Grant raw socket capabilities (Linux only)
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/local/bin/netweaver
```

## Quick Start

### Scan Your Local Network

Discover all devices on your LAN with open port detection:

```bash
netweaver scan --lan --threads 100
```

This will:
- Automatically detect your network range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- Scan all hosts using 100 concurrent threads
- Show IP addresses, MAC addresses, vendors, and open ports
- Display approximate latency to each device

Want to scan specific ports or a custom range?

```bash
# Scan specific target with custom ports
netweaver scan --target 192.168.1.0/24 --ports 22,80,443,3306,5432

# Scan port ranges
netweaver scan --target 10.0.0.0/24 --ports 1-1024,8000-9000

# Generate network topology visualization
netweaver scan --lan --topology --output network.json
```

### Trace Routes with Intelligence

See exactly how your packets travel to their destination:

```bash
netweaver trace --target github.com
```

Each hop shows:
- IP address and hostname (when available)
- Multiple RTT measurements per hop
- Average latency and packet loss percentage
- Anomaly detection for unusual delays

Export trace data for analysis:

```bash
netweaver trace --target 8.8.8.8 --max-hops 20 --probes 5 --output trace.json
```

### Optimize Your Connection

Let NetWeaver analyze and tune your network settings:

```bash
# Dry run - see recommendations without making changes
netweaver optimize --all --dry-run

# Apply all optimizations (requires root)
sudo netweaver optimize --all

# Optimize specific components
sudo netweaver optimize --dns      # Find fastest DNS resolver
sudo netweaver optimize --mtu      # Detect optimal MTU
sudo netweaver optimize --tcp      # Tune TCP parameters

# Enable turbo mode for adaptive learning
sudo netweaver optimize --turbo
```

Turbo mode analyzes your network usage patterns and automatically applies the best configuration profiles for your workload.

### Monitor in Real-Time

Watch your network traffic live with the interactive dashboard:

```bash
# Launch real-time TUI dashboard
sudo netweaver monitor --realtime

# Monitor specific interface
sudo netweaver monitor --realtime --interface eth0

# Filter by protocol
sudo netweaver monitor --realtime --protocol tcp

# Run as background daemon with logging
sudo netweaver monitor --daemon --log /var/log/netweaver.log
```

The dashboard shows:
- Current bandwidth usage (sent/received)
- Packet counters and error rates
- Active connections with states
- Protocol distribution

Press `q` to quit the real-time monitor.

### Generate Reports

Create detailed network analysis reports:

```bash
# Generate JSON report
netweaver report --export network-report.json

# Generate HTML report with graphs
netweaver report --export report.html --format html --graphs

# Include historical data
netweaver report --export analysis.yaml --format yaml --history
```

### Deep Packet Inspection

Capture and analyze network traffic:

```bash
# Capture 1000 packets
sudo netweaver inspect --interface eth0 --count 1000

# Apply BPF filter
sudo netweaver inspect --filter "tcp port 443" --count 500

# Save capture to file
sudo netweaver inspect --output capture.pcap --count 10000

# Capture and analyze
sudo netweaver inspect --interface any --analyze
```

### Security Auditing

Run comprehensive security checks:

```bash
# Run all security checks
sudo netweaver security --all

# Individual checks
sudo netweaver security --arp-detect    # Check for ARP spoofing
netweaver security --vpn-test           # Test VPN integrity
sudo netweaver security --port-scan     # Scan for open ports
sudo netweaver security --mitm-detect   # Look for MITM indicators
```

## Architecture

NetWeaver uses a hybrid architecture that plays to the strengths of both C and Rust:

### C Core Layer (`c_core/`)
Handles all performance-critical operations:
- Raw socket creation and management
- Low-level packet crafting (ICMP, TCP, UDP)
- Zero-copy packet parsing
- Hardware-accelerated checksumming
- Buffer pool management for stable memory usage

The C layer is compiled with `-O3` optimization and exposes a clean API to Rust via FFI bindings generated by `bindgen`.

### Rust Engine Layer (`src/`)
Manages high-level logic and safety:
- Async/await runtime using Tokio for concurrent operations
- Command-line interface with clap
- Real-time TUI dashboard with ratatui
- Analytics and pattern recognition
- Safe data structures with Arc/Mutex for shared state
- Serialization to JSON/YAML

### Plugin System
NetWeaver supports runtime plugin loading for extensibility:
- Write plugins in Rust or C
- Hook into packet processing pipeline
- Add custom analyzers and exporters
- Simple API for rapid development

## Performance

NetWeaver is built for speed:

- **Network scanning**: 10,000+ hosts/minute on modern hardware
- **Packet capture**: Line-rate processing on gigabit links
- **Memory footprint**: ~15MB typical RSS with buffer pools
- **Zero-copy design**: Minimal allocations in hot paths
- **Async I/O**: epoll/kqueue for scalable concurrent operations

## Security Considerations

NetWeaver requires elevated privileges for certain operations:

- **Raw sockets**: Needed for ICMP, custom packet crafting
- **Network interface access**: Required for packet capture
- **System parameter modification**: Optimization features may change sysctl values

**Best practices:**
- Use capabilities instead of full root when possible
- Review optimization changes in dry-run mode first
- Run monitoring in unprivileged mode when packet capture isn't needed
- Keep NetWeaver updated for security patches

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" errors

Many NetWeaver features require root or specific capabilities:

```bash
# Option 1: Run with sudo
sudo netweaver scan --lan

# Option 2: Grant capabilities (Linux only)
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /path/to/netweaver
```

### Build failures

If you encounter build errors:

```bash
# Ensure you have the latest Rust toolchain
rustup update

# Install missing dependencies
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libpcap-dev

# Clean and rebuild
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```

### High CPU usage during scans

This is normal for intensive network scanning. To reduce load:

```bash
# Reduce thread count
netweaver scan --lan --threads 50

# Scan fewer ports
netweaver scan --lan --ports 22,80,443
```
